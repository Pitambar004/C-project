ðŸš— Parking Charge Calculator in C
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This C program calculates parking charges based on how long a customer has parked. It uses a simple billing rule:

A minimum flat rate of $2.00 is charged for up to 3 hours.

After 3 hours, the charge is $0.50 per additional hour.

The maximum charge is $10.00 for any 24-hour period.

The program continuously takes input from the user (parking duration in hours), calculates the charge using a function, keeps track of the total collected amount, and displays the charge for each customer along with the running total.
